## Love Notes

### 1. When you need encouragement

**Original:**
"Hey you. I know things feel hard right now, but I need you to remember something: you have overcome every single difficult thing life has thrown at you so far. Every single one. This challenge is no different. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and loved more than you know. I believe in you completely - not because I have to, but because I've seen what you're capable of. You've got this. And whatever happens, I'm right here."

**Current:**
"You've handled 100% of your bad days so far. That's a pretty good track record. This one's no different. I'm here, and I believe in you."

### 2. When you want to laugh

**Original:**
"You know what I love about us? We turn disasters into adventures and mistakes into memories. The best moments are never the planned ones - they're the ones where everything goes sideways and we end up laughing until we can't breathe. You make everything more fun, even the mundane stuff. Especially the mundane stuff. Your laugh is my favorite sound in the world, and making you happy is my favorite thing to do."

**Current:**
"Remember when we laughed so hard we couldn't breathe? Let's do that again soon. Your laugh is still my favorite sound."

### 3. When you miss me

**Original:**
"Close your eyes. Take a breath. Now imagine I'm right there with you, because in all the ways that matter, I am. I'm in the songs that remind you of us, in the inside jokes no one else gets, in the way you smile when you think of something we did together. Distance and time are just details - what we have transcends all of that. I'm carrying you with me everywhere I go, and I know you're doing the same. We'll be together again soon. Until then, know that you're my favorite thought."

**Current:**
"\"In true love, the smallest distance is too great, and the greatest distance can be bridged.\" - Hans Nouwens. Miss you too. See you soon."

### 4. When you need a reminder of how loved you are

**Original:**
"Let me count the ways: I love how your eyes light up when you talk about things you're passionate about. I love your laugh - the real one, not the polite one. I love how you remember the little things about people. I love your courage, even when you don't see it in yourself. I love your kindness, your curiosity, your terrible puns. I love who you are when no one is watching. I love who we are together. You are so deeply, completely, impossibly loved. Never doubt that."

**Current:**
"I love the way you get excited about things. I love how you make me laugh. I love how you are exactly yourself. That's it. That's the message."

### 5. When you're having a rough day

**Original:**
"I'm sorry today is being unkind to you. I wish I could take whatever is weighing on you and carry it for a while. Since I can't, let me offer this: bad days end. They always do. Tomorrow is a fresh start, and this feeling isn't permanent even when it feels like it is. Be gentle with yourself today. Drink some water, take a breath, do one small thing that brings you comfort. And remember - even on your worst days, you are worthy of love and rest. I'm proud of you for getting through this."

**Current:**
"Bad days end. This feeling is temporary. Be kind to yourself today - you deserve it. Tomorrow's a new day."

### 6. When you can't sleep

**Original:**
"The night can feel so long when your mind won't quiet down. So here's a thought to keep you company: somewhere out there, at this exact moment, I'm thinking of you too. Think about all the quiet, peaceful moments we've shared - the way the world seems to slow down when we're together. Let that calm feeling wash over you. You are safe. You are loved. Tomorrow will come with its own light. For now, just breathe, and know that you don't have to figure anything out tonight."

**Current:**
"\"The night is darkest just before the dawn.\" - Harvey Dent. But also: counting sheep is overrated. Try thinking about that ridiculous thing that made us laugh yesterday."

### 7. When you're overthinking

**Original:**
"Hey, I can feel you spiraling from here. Take a breath. Now another. Whatever you're worried about - the outcome doesn't change how I feel about you. Not even a little. You don't have to have it all figured out. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to do this alone. Some things will work out, some won't, and either way we'll figure it out together. Right now, in this moment, you are enough. You always have been."

**Current:**
"Stop. Breathe. You don't need to figure everything out tonight. Some things work out, some don't. Either way, we're good."

### 8. When you crushed it today

**Original:**
"YES! I knew you would! I am so incredibly proud of you right now. Not surprised - I always knew you had it in you - but so, so proud. You worked hard for this moment, and you earned every bit of it. Take a second to really feel this. Celebrate yourself. You deserve this win, and you deserve to enjoy it fully. I can't wait to hear all about it. Tonight, we celebrate YOU."

**Current:**
"TOLD YOU. Proud of you. You worked hard for this and you earned it. Now celebrate - you deserve it."

### 9. When you want to feel adventurous

**Original:**
"Let's dream for a minute: Imagine us watching the sunrise from a mountain we climbed together. Getting lost in a city where we don't speak the language. Trying food we can't pronounce. Dancing in the rain in a foreign country. Learning to sail. Building a life full of stories worth telling. Our adventure is just beginning, and there's so much world left to explore together. Whatever wild idea is calling to you right now? Let's chase it. Say the word, and we'll make it happen."

**Current:**
"\"Twenty years from now you'll be more disappointed by the things you didn't do.\" - Mark Twain. So what adventure are we doing next? Say the word."

### 10. When you need to hear why I chose you

**Original:**
"I chose you because when I'm with you, I'm the best version of myself. I chose you because you make ordinary life feel like an adventure. I chose you because your heart is kind and your spirit is strong and your soul understands mine in a way no one else ever has. I chose you because in a world full of people, you're the only one I want to build a life with. And here's the thing - I would choose you again. In a hundred different lifetimes, in a hundred different worlds, in any version of reality, I would find you and I would choose you. Always."

**Current:**
"Because you're you. Because you make regular days better. Because I'm myself around you. Because I want to. Simple as that."
